# `src/notes/` — Notes View (React)

The folder/file browser, tabbed editor, and live markdown editor for
notes (NPCs, locations, factions, plots, etc.). React, not vanilla DOM.

## Layout

```
notes/
  Notes.tsx                   # slice orchestrator (see "Notes.tsx ceiling" below)
  types.ts
  hooks/
    useSaveSync.ts            # autosave + mtime conflict
    useFolderTree.ts          # tree memoisation
    useLinkPicker.ts          # @ autocomplete
    useCaretTracking.ts       # selection/caret state
  components/
    FolderSidebar.tsx
    EditorTabs.tsx
    BreadcrumbNav.tsx
    EditorContent.tsx         # mode dispatcher (live/source/split)
    QuickAdd.tsx
    NoteContextMenu.tsx
  editor/
    LiveEditor.tsx
    LinkPickerDropdown.tsx
    markdown/
      inline.ts               # escHtml, renderInline
      line.ts                 # classifyLine, lineHtml
      caret.ts                # save/restoreCaret
    upload.ts                 # handlePaste image conversion
```

A `services/` folder may be added when a piece of non-React logic is
testable and reused. None of the current code qualifies — see the
Notes.tsx ceiling note below for why the file-operations handlers stay
on the orchestrator.

## Notes.tsx ceiling

`Notes.tsx` is around 730 lines — over both the 300-line soft cap and
the 500-line hard cap from `app/AGENTS.md`. This is a **documented
exception**, not the new normal: every clean extraction has been tried
and rejected. The file-ops handlers (`handleRename`,
`handleDeleteFile`, `handleMove`, `migrateKey`, `migrateDirKeys`) each
touch ~10 setState slots; pulling them into a hook would mean
threading every setter through a deps object — the abstraction would
be larger than the code it hides.

The cap exists to keep files navigable for agents; the orchestrator's
size is currently the cost of that decision. **Don't grow it.** New
behaviour goes into a hook, component, or service. If you find
yourself adding orchestrator-level glue and the file climbs past
800 lines, that's the trigger to revisit — candidates are moving the
rename/delete UI state into `FolderSidebar` end-to-end, or biting the
bullet on a `useNotesFileOps(state, setters)` hook even with the
setter-threading cost.

## Layer rules

- May import `data/ports.ts` types and receive a port via deps (or via
  a top-level provider — Notes.tsx is the composition root for this
  slice).
- May import `domain/*` for shared logic.
- May not import `timeline/*`, `panels/*`, `editor/*`, `peek/*`.

## React conventions

- One component per file. Filename matches the export.
- **Hooks** for state and effects. Extract a hook when a block of
  `useState` / `useEffect` is over ~30 lines or reused.
- **Components** for JSX only. They take props, return JSX, do nothing
  else.
- **Services** (`services/`) for non-React logic that needs to be
  testable without a renderer. File ops, link resolution, etc.
- **Markdown helpers** (`editor/markdown/`) are pure functions. No
  React, no DOM beyond what the contentEditable layer needs.
- Styles are global CSS in `src/styles/notes/`. Don't introduce
  CSS-in-JS or CSS modules.

## Add a feature

See `.claude/skills/add-notes-feature/SKILL.md`. Decide first whether
it's:

- A **hook** — state or side effect.
- A **component** — JSX.
- A **service** — pure logic.
- A **markdown helper** — pure rendering of markdown bits.

Each lives in its respective folder. Don't dump everything into
`Notes.tsx`.

## Conventions

- Tabs persist via localStorage key `notes.openTabs.v1`.
- File state ('clean' / 'dirty' / 'saving' / 'conflict') comes from
  `useSaveSync`. Don't track it in component state separately.
- Drag-drop uses HTML5 drag API. Payloads are JSON-encoded.

## Don't

- Don't call `fetch` directly. Go through the data port.
- Don't write to disk paths from React. The data port hides paths.
- Don't reimplement folder tree state. `useFolderTree` is the source
  of truth.
